          <h3>About Gwen</h3>
          <div class="about-bio">
            <p>Hi, I'm Gwen.</p>
            <p>Originally from Alabama, I've called New Jersey home for nearly 20 years. My background is in corporate Human Resources, where I spent my career helping others navigate change and make meaningful decisions. That same passion for helping people is at the heart of what I do today.</p>
            <p>This journey started about five years ago when my Uncle George passed away. My Aunt decided to relocate from Connecticut to Alabama to be closer to my parents, and I spent many weekends at her home, helping her sort through a lifetime of belongings collected over more than 50 years.</p>
            <p>What I discovered during that time was powerful: it wasn't the objects themselves that mattered most ‚Äî it was the memories they held. As we worked together, she shared stories, laughter, and sometimes tears, as each item unlocked a moment in time.</p>
            <p>Many items didn't have much monetary value, but that didn't mean they belonged in a landfill. I made it a mission to find homes for as many things as possible ‚Äî because I believe our things should be loved, appreciated, and useful, even if by someone new.</p>
            <p>Now, I help others do the same ‚Äî whether you're downsizing, moving, clearing out a storage space, or just ready to simplify. I'm here to make the process less overwhelming and more meaningful.</p>
            <p><strong>Let's uncover what matters and let go of what doesn't ‚Äî together.</strong></p>

                <p class="review-text">I was an eBay powerseller, so my home was full of things I had collected over 40 years. When it was time to move, I was overwhelmed and also embarrassed about everything that I had. But, I didn't want someone to come in and throw it all out, because I know what the value is. Gwen was a lifesaver! She was so quick and efficient... and strong, no idea how she hauled so much out of my basement... she was able to help me decide what I wanted to take with me, and she sold things for me on eBay! She also let me know how values have changed over the years. I was sad to learn that the Lladros aren't as sought after as they were 20 years ago.</p>

                <p class="review-text">I had a storage unit full of items that belonged to my late husband. I've been waiting 5 years for my kids to help clean it out and finally realized it was never going to happen. Gwen came in, organized everything, started a private Facebook group for my 4 kids and 6 grandchildren and posted pictures of what I had saved so they all had a chance to claim what they wanted. She went through everything with me and even though she is a very quick worker, she is very patient and kind. We bonded over a lifetime of my memories and she feels like part of the family. She shipped everything to everyone who wanted things and took boxes and boxes of loose photos which are being digitized and put into a website that everyone in the family will be able to access forever. I cannot recommend her enough.</p>

                <p class="review-text">As I go through things in my home and storage unit, I call Gwen to come and pick up boxes of items that I want sold. I don't know how she does it but I get Venmo almost daily from everything that she's selling for me. She has sold so many tools and kitchen items and I'm so happy to have a clean garage and feel like my basement is slowly getting cleared out at a pace I am comfortable with.</p>

                <p class="review-text">I'm embarrassed at what my situation was, I actually was told I was going to be evicted from my apartment because of a hoarding situation. I was desperate and referred to Gwen. She came the next day, and not only did she not judge me, she actually was very encouraging during the clean out process. So much of what I held onto was things I wanted to give away or recycle and she just took it and did it. I think that I was so overwhelmed that I didn't know where to start and she took us step by step and by the end of the weekend, it was like I had a new apartment. It passed inspection and I'm following her advice and maintaining the work that she did.</p>
